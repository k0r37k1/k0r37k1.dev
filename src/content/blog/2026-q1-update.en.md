Happy New Year! 🎆 Quick update on what's happening.

## Business Address

Finally got an official address – technically a mailbox at a business address service.
But hey, better than having my home address in the imprint. ✅

## Google Developer Account

Application submitted, waiting for response. No Play Store releases without the account. Just gotta wait. ⏳

## Apps in Progress

Two projects in the pipeline:

📝 **Plain Text Editor** – Simple text editor. No bloatware, no unnecessary features. Open, type, save. Done.

😴 **DoZzzy** – Nap timer app. Start your powernap, timer runs, gentle alarm.
For everyone who wants a quick midday nap without sleeping away the whole afternoon.

Both apps drop as soon as Google gives the green light. 🚀

## Portfolio Updates

- Removed some animations – less is more
- Updated privacy policy – GDPR stuff brought up to date

Next update when Google responds or the apps are ready. ✌️
