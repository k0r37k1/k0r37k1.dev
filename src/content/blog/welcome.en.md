Portfolio is up, blog is live. Time for the first entry. 🎉

## What goes here

- 🚀 **Project updates** – When something changes in the portfolio, it's here.
- 🔧 **Tech stuff** – Vue, Astro, Flutter, AI workflows. What I learn, what works, what doesn't.
- 🛠️ **Tool reviews** – Claude Code, Cursor, new libraries. No hype, honest takes.
- 💡 **Random findings** – Bugs that cost me hours. Performance tricks. Stuff I wish I knew earlier.

## What doesn't

Tutorial spam. "10 tips for..." lists. Content for the sake of content. 🙅

## Format

Short. Direct. Code when needed, screenshots when helpful. More log than blog.

Next post when something happens. ✌️
